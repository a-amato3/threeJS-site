        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
            I am 27 years old and have a background in Spatial Data Science and Visualisation. My strengths lie in Front
            End
            development,
            using frameworks such as Angular and Flutter. I am interested in smart cities, IoT and how new technologies
            can
            be used to
            improve living standards.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of work I like to run and go hiking whenever possible. I also love to cook and read non-fiction.
            Before
            the pandemic I tried
            to visit a new country every year and travel as much as possible.
