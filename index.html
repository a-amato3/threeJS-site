      <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
      <p>
        I am 27 years old and have a background in Spatial Data Science and Visualisation. My strengths lie in Front End
        development,
        using frameworks such as Angular and Flutter. I am interested in smart cities, IoT and how new technologies can
        be used to
        improve living standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work I like to run and go hiking whenever possible. I also love to cook and read non-fiction. Before
        the pandemic I tried
        to visit a new country every year and travel as much as possible.

        build a software platform for the
        Biotech industry to catalogue and manage their workflows in the area of advanced treatment of stem cell patients
        which helps manage data in a secure and
        reliable way.
